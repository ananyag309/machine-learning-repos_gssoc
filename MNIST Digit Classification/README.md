# DESCRIPTION

The project focuses on leveraging neural networks to achieve accurate image classification using the MNIST dataset. The dataset comprises handwritten digits, and the objective is to develop a robust model capable of categorizing these digits into ten predefined classes. By harnessing advanced deep learning techniques, the neural networks will learn intricate patterns and features within the images, facilitating precise classification. This endeavor not only emphasizes the application of cutting-edge technology but also contributes to the broader field of machine learning, with potential implications for diverse domains, including pattern recognition, digitization, and artificial intelligence.

# WHAT I HAD DONE

I have created 2 different nueral network models to correctly classify digits into 10 classes. One model is built using artificial neural networks and the other is built using convolutional neural networks. In both the models EDA has been done along with hyperparameter tuning to achieve high accuracy

# MODELS USED

<ul>
    <li>Artificial neural networks</li>

</ul>
Neural networks have been used to solve the problem at hand as they tend to perform better than regular machine learning algorithms as they can capture more information and non-linear features. Convolutional neural network is a special type of neural network that is made to perfrom better on images and videos

# CONCLUSION

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrate superiority over traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in image-related tasks due to their specialized architecture. CNNs excel in capturing spatial hierarchies and local patterns within images through convolutional layers, which employ filters to detect features like edges and textures. This enables CNNs to preserve spatial relationships, making them highly effective for tasks like image classification and object recognition. In contrast, ANNs lack the inherent capacity to recognize spatial patterns efficiently, making them less adept at handling image data. The hierarchical and localized learning of CNNs makes them particularly well-suited for computer vision applications, outperforming ANNs in tasks that demand nuanced understanding of visual content. It is clearly observable from the scores that CNNs perform better than ANNs
