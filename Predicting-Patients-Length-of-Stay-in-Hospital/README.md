## Goal
The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the duration of a patient's hospital stay to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care.

## Dataset
I have Downloaded this dataset from kaggle website. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/av-healthcare-analytics-ii

## Conclusion:
The project "Predicting the Patients Length of Stay in Hospital" successfully developed a predictive model to estimate hospital stay durations. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis and visualization, important patterns and correlations were identified. Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated, and the final model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities with high accuracy. The results were compiled into a detailed report and submitted to stakeholders, providing actionable insights for optimizing hospital resources and enhancing patient care. Future work will focus on improving data quality, experimenting with advanced modeling techniques, and integrating the model into hospital management systems for real-time decision support.
